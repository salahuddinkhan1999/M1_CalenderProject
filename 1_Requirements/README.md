# Introduction
* Calender is a project which enables user to know any corresponding day for any valid date of the year.
* User can also know entire date schedule of the month by just entering month and year.
* User can also save a note on any date of any month.

# Objective
* In this world of growing technologies everything has been computerized. With large number of work opportunities the human workforce has increased.
* So this calender in short provides shortcut to the user to know any corresponding day for any valid date, know entire schedule of the month, and also allows the user to save a note.
 
 # SWOT(Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) Analysis
   * Strengths describe what an organization excels at and what separates it from the competition: a strong brand, loyal customer base, a strong balance sheet, unique technology, and so on. For example, a hedge fund may have developed a proprietary trading strategy that returns market-beating results. It must then decide how to use those results to attract new investors.
   * Weaknesses stop an organization from performing at its optimum level. They are areas where the business needs to improve to remain competitive: a weak brand, higher-than-average turnover, high levels of debt, an inadequate supply chain, or lack of capital.
   * Opportunities refer to favorable external factors that could give an organization a competitive advantage. For example, if a country cuts tariffs, a car manufacturer can export its cars into a new market, increasing sales and market share.
   * Threats refer to factors that have the potential to harm an organization. For example, a drought is a threat to a wheat-producing company, as it may destroy or reduce the crop yield. Other common threats include things like rising costs for materials, increasing competition, tight labor supply. and so on.
